This is a very basic guessing game about rowing.  The user is prompted to guess how many meters are raced in a competition held annually in San Diego.  Whether the user guesses too few or too many, he is prompted to try again.  Once the user guesses the correct answer, he is congratulated and prompted to join the sport.
